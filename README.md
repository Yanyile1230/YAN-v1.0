This is a tool that can encrypt and decrypt Chinese and English. Sometimes it will report an error in Chinese. I am a sixth-grade student and this is my first Java work. It is inevitable that there will be errors. I hope you can give me more advice. If you find any errors, you can send your suggestions to: yanlele123456@outlook.com or yanyile123456@outlook.com. I will modify it as soon as I see it. Thank you! ! !
